# Crime Prediction and Analysis Using Clustering and Regression Methods

Crime is a threat to humans caused by fellow beings 
which can be punishable by the law of government. A 
study of crime and the sciences that collects and 
investigate data on it and crime performance is called 
Criminology . The activities of crime had been 
constantly increasing and it is the responsibility of the 
police to control and prevent it. Crime analysis and its 
prediction is difficult for the police as the volume of data 
is large. Therefore we need scientific methods to predict 
and analyze crime. This way the time and space is 
reduced. There are two methods of data mining for this 
purpose. They are clustering and regression methods 
respectively. The grouping of similar data is called 
clustering . The dense spots are known as clusters and 
the rest is called noise. With the help of clustering, the 
data are sorted according to the conditions given. 
Regression is a method which helps to predict the crime 
in future with the given cluster of data .The objective 
of our work is to predict and analyze crimes in 38 
different cities of Tamil Nadu by using clustering and 
regression methods. For this purpose K-Means and 
DBSCAN algorithms are used for clustering the data. The 
clustered data is then compared using silhouette coefficient algorithm,
from which the most effective 
clustering method from K-means and DBSCAN is 
determined for the given data set. The clustered 
data is then sent to Regression methods such as ridge, 
naive Bayes, and linear for predicting crime for the given 
data set and the result is viewed in the form of graphs. 
The efficiency of each regression methods is determined 
using root mean square method. Big dataâ€“Hive is used for 
data storage in order to enhance privacy and security to 
protect the crime data.
